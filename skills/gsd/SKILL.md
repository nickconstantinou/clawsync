# GSD (Get Shit Done) Skill

GSD is a spec-driven development framework that interviews you, builds a plan, then executes phase by phase with verification.

## Installation

GSD is already installed at `~/.claude/get-shit-done/`

## Usage

GSD works through conversation prompts. For OpenClaw, you can use these commands:

### Start New Project
Tell GSD about your project idea. It will:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Research domain (optional)
3. Create REQUIREMENTS.md
4. Create ROADMAP.md
5. Set up project memory

### Plan Phase
After project creation: `/gsd:plan-phase <phase-number>`

### Execute Phase
Run a specific phase with verification

### Check Todos
See pending tasks

## Manual Usage

You can also manually trigger GSD commands by reading the command files and guiding the user through them:

```bash
# List available GSD commands
ls ~/.claude/commands/gsd/
```

## Commands Available

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| gsd:new-project | Initialize new project |
| gsd:plan-phase | Plan a specific phase |
| gsd:execute-phase | Execute a phase |
| gsd:research-phase | Research domain |
| gsd:check-todos | View pending tasks |
| gsd:progress | Show progress |
| gsd:health | Check project health |

## Example Workflow

1. User: "I want to build a todo app"
2. You: Use the GSD methodology - ask questions, then guide through requirements → roadmap → execution
3. Create `.planning/PROJECT.md` with context
4. Create `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
5. Create `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
